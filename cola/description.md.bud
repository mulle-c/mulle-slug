Create a [slug](https://de.ryte.com/wiki/Slug) from some arbitrary text,
suitable for inclusion in a URL as a path or fragment.

#### What is a Slug?

A slug is a URL-safe representation of a page title, often used in web
development to create clean and readable URLs.
Slugs are typically all lowercase and replace spaces with hyphens, making them
more human-friendly than raw URL-encoded strings.
For example, the page title "A Beginner's Guide to Web Development" could have
the slug "a-beginners-guide-to-web-development". The term "slug" is derived
from the publishing industry, where it refers to a short, descriptive label for
an article or story. **mulle-slug** preserves case though.
